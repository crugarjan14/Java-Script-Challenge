JavaScript Challenge

Creating a basic HTML web using the UFO-related dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, writing a code that appends a table in the web page and adding new rows of data for each UFO sighting. The web page presents columns for `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment`. It also contains date and city forms that listen for events and search through the `date/time` or ‘city’ column to find rows that match user input.
